# Cryptocurrencies
## OVERVIEW

"In this project, we aim to use unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze data on cryptocurrencies. To do so, we first preprocess the data obtained from CryptoCompare using Pandas. Then, we apply a clustering algorithm to group the data into meaningful clusters. Finally, we use hvPlot visualizations to present our findings and share our results with others.
